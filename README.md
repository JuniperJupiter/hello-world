My favorite color is prussian blue: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_blue

I am now going to attempt to recite Lewis Carroll's "The Jabberwocky" from memory:

Twas brillig and the slythy toves did gyre and gimble in the wae/
All mimzy were the borogoves and the mome-raths outgrabe/
"Beware the Jabberwock, my son/
The jaws that bite and the claws that catch,/
Beware the Jubjub bird and shun the frumious Bandersnatch!"/
He took his vorpal sword in hand,/
long time the manxome foe he sought/
So rested he by a tumtum tree and stood awile in thought...
I lost it. I can't remember the order of the last few lines.
